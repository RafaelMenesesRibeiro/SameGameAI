# SameGame-AI
Artificial Intelligence project #1

### Methods that need to be implemented in class "Problem"
> __init__
> actions
> result
> value

### Classes that are already implemented
> Node
A node in a search tree. Contains a pointer to the parent (the node that this is a successor of) and to the actual state for this node.
Also includes the action that got us to this state, and the total path_cost (also known as g) to reach the node.
> SimpleProblemSolvingAgentProgram, OnlineSearchProblem, PeakFindingProblem, AStarAgent, OnlineDFSAgent and others
Contains several, already implemented Search Algorithms
> Various Graph related classes
> Lots of trash not related with SameGame problem
