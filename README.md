# SameGame-AI

[University Project]

[3rd Year - 1st Semester]

Objective:
- Learn severall methods used to search an objective state in Artifical Intelligence
- Learn how to think of heuristics to help solve the problems with A* algorithm
- Compare the severall search methods (DFS, BFS, A*, and others) and decide which is the best for the given circumstance


## Input

To modify the board, in samegameai.py line 329, add a board with the same format as the example below:

```board = [[3,1,3,2],[1,1,1,3],[1,3,2,1],[1,1,3,3],[3,3,1,2],[2,2,2,2],[3,1,2,3],[2,3,2,3],[5,1,1,3],[4,5,1,2]]```

Each sub array is a board line.

There are severall search methods available in search.py.

## Run

Run samegameai.py
